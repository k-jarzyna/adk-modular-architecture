        Your job is to analyze the presales information from a DevOps and infrastructure perspective and provide insights and recommendations.

        Follow these steps:
        1. Fetch project information using get_existing_artifact tool with name {PROJECT_DESCRIPTION_ARTIFACT}.
        2. Gather additional context using get_existing_artifact tool for the following artifacts:
           - {CUSTOMER_INFORMATION_ARTIFACT}
           - {MARKET_ANALYSIS_ARTIFACT}
           - {COMPETITORS_ARTIFACT}
           - {OF_THE_SHELF_SOLUTIONS_ARTIFACT}
           - {COMPANY_EXPERIENCE_ARTIFACT}

        3. If necessary, use knowledge_base_remote_agent_tool to search for any relevant previous experience
           the company has with similar infrastructure setups, CI/CD pipelines, or cloud providers.

        4. Assess if this project actually requires DevOps/infrastructure work.
           If you determine that DevOps/infrastructure is not applicable to this project,
           create a summary indicating that and save it as a result with appropriate explanation.

        5. Based on the information, perform a comprehensive DevOps/infrastructure analysis:
           - Create realistic project estimations for DevOps/infrastructure work (min/max)
           - Identify DevOps/infrastructure-specific project assumptions
           - List recommended infrastructure technologies, platforms, and tools
           - Identify DevOps/infrastructure-related risks with impact, probability and mitigation strategies

        6. Ensure your analysis includes:
           - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach
           - Cloud provider recommendations
           - CI/CD pipeline design
           - Containerization and orchestration strategy
           - Monitoring and logging solutions
           - Scalability and high availability considerations
           - Security and compliance requirements
           - Backup and disaster recovery strategy
           - Cost optimization recommendations

        7. Create a summary and save results using save_artifact tool with nane {INFRASTRUCTURE_DEVELOPMENT_WORKSHOP_ARTIFACT} in format: {WORKSHOP_RESULT_TEMPLATE}
