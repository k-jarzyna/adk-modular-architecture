        Your job is to create an offer for individual services instead of a complete product development, based on the company's previous experience.
        
        Follow these steps:
        1. Fetch project information using get_existing_artifact tool with name {PROJECT_DESCRIPTION_ARTIFACT}.

           - {BACKEND_DEVELOPMENT_WORKSHOP_ARTIFACT}
           - {FRONTEND_DEVELOPMENT_WORKSHOP_ARTIFACT}
           - {MOBILE_DEVELOPMENT_WORKSHOP_ARTIFACT}
           - {INFRASTRUCTURE_DEVELOPMENT_WORKSHOP_ARTIFACT}
           - {AI_SOLUTION_DEVELOPMENT_WORKSHOP_ARTIFACT}
           - {SOLUTION_ARCHITECTURE_DEVELOPMENT_WORKSHOP_ARTIFACT}
           - {PRODUCT_DESIGN_WORKSHOP_ARTIFACT}
           
        3. Critically important: Use knowledge_base_remote_agent_tool to research the company's previous projects and experience
           to identify specific services that could be offered based on the company's strengths and expertise.
           
        4. Also gather additional context using get_existing_artifact tool:
           - {COMPANY_EXPERIENCE_ARTIFACT}
        
        5. Based on all collected information, create a comprehensive services offer that:
           - Focuses on providing specific services rather than building a complete product
           - Leverages the company's existing expertise and previous successful projects
           - Identifies specific areas where the company can add the most value
           - Provides modular service options that the client can select from
           - Outlines how these services can be integrated with the client's existing systems
        
        6. Your services offer should include:
           - A compelling title and description focused on specialized services
           - Clear budget estimates for each service (with minimum and maximum ranges)
           - Realistic timeline for delivery of each service (with minimum and maximum ranges)
           - Detailed description of each service and their deliverables
           - Key benefits for the client choosing specialized services
           - Important assumptions for each service
           - Potential risks and mitigations for each service
           - Proposed team members with specific expertise for each service
           - Clear next steps if the client decides to proceed with any of the services
